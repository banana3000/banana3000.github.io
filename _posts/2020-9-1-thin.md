title: 代数、几何、分析、数论
---

When I was very naive (e.g maybe 7-8 years ago), I found that big words were very attractive. You can say a lot things without understanding any of them, or recommend a lot of books without even reading the introduction. This is not a bad thing, at least you're curious about what you don't know.

However, most people only talk about old stories again and again, repeat or copy the words of others on general pictures. They throw out a lot of tags on a lot of things, strengthening the stereotypes.

For example, it's crazy that someone tells you to do any research in algebraic geometry, you need to learn EGA, SGA, FGA, Stacks project, Toën's derived algebraic geometry, birational geometry, Hodge theory, real algebraic geometry, moduli spaces (of curves, vector bundles, abelian varieties), toric geometry, abelian varieties, Orlov's works on D^b(Coh(X)), stability conditions, quiver varieties, hyperplane arrangements, XXX varieties (XXX is the name of one or more mathematicians e.g Kummer, Calabi-Yau, Fano, O'Grady, K3) ...

This is not a bad thing, maybe you want to show there are so many interesting mathematics, but don't want to say more than 10 words on each topic as then you can keep the mysterious masks on them.

But I won't do it in that way as so many people online have done such things. They are better than me, I know that I know nothing.

I hope to write things that no one has ever said before, things that are interesting and cool, sharpening our understanding on new and old topics. I won't give every detail but give you an idea, or a guide, revealing the story line of one thing. Of course, I am not good at it, so I will improve it by doing it.

表示论，数论，代数几何都是很大的话题，具体在研究什么取决于你关心的具体领域和问题。联系处处可见，但在你关心的部分也可以毫无联系。泛泛而谈的话，难度也不可能量化，也许你要证明的命题恰好是independent of ZFC的，那无法证明正确，也无法证明错误。每个大的领域（按你所列的）都可能有这样的问题（例如测度论里分部积分的Fubini定理的一个加强版本）：

那该怎么谈难度呢？

如果真的想要寻求建议的话，不如先去随便学一点，找到自己喜欢的事。做自己喜欢的事，是最快乐的。
