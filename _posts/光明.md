Jean Leray (1906-1998):
1. Research before WWII: PDEs with some applications from
topology
2. 1940-1945: Prisoner of war camp, in Austria.
3. Does research in algebraic topology from scratch, because he
didn’t want to help German authorities and their war-related
research.
4. Comes up with sheaves and spectral sequences (Leray sp. sec.)
5. Modern methods in algebraic topology are born!

André Weil (1906-1998):
1. Research in algebraic geometry and number theory.
2. 1939-1940: Gets sentenced to jail by the French authorities,
because he didn’t want to fight in the war.
3. Comes up with his well known conjectures.
4. Introduces the Jacobian variety and solves his conjectures for
the case of curves.
5. The journey of modern algebraic geometry begins!
